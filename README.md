## MARC_Fall_2020

This repository is developed by Jacob Green to organize and support URI MARC students over the Fall semester of 2020. We will be scheduling meetings, planning sessions, and other resources through this directory. If you have any questions please reach out to me at here gree9242@uri.edu.

### Description



### Fall Meetings

These meetings are meant to provide a platform for MARC trainees to discuss their ideas, triumphs, and concerns over their summer research program while also providing opportunities to develop materials and the scholarly identity needed to succeed in academia and applying to graduate school. Meetings will last from and 1.5 to 2 hours. The typical meeting will be outlined as follows:

* Check-in (10-20 minutes)
* Warm-up (10-20 minutes)
* Meeting activity (50-60 minutes)
* Wrap-up (20 minutes)

Check-ins will give trainees the opportunity to update coordinators about what is going on in their programs and how they are doing. It will also allow coordinators to communicate 

Warm-up's are meant to help students organize, prioritize, and record their ideas.

Meeting activities will vary depending on the goals of the session and what trainees would like to accomplish. Professional development will be focused on preparing for graduate school applications, summer research experience applications, identifying funding opportunities, writing research abstracts, communicating research, and CV/academic resume building. 

Wrap-up's will be a closing opportunity that will help trainees summarize what work was accomplished in the meeting session and to clarify any support they need moving forward.
